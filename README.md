# Simplexn

The $Simple^n_X$ library, named **simplexn** within the Python version of the LARCC framework, provides combinatorial algorithms for some basic functions of geometric modelling with simplicial complexes. In particular, provides the efficient creation of simplicial complexes generated by simplicial complexes of lower dimension, the production of simplicial grids of any dimension, and the extraction of facets (i.e. of ($dâˆ’1$)-faces) of complexes of $d$-simplices.
